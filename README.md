# blender-python
This is a project to teach basic python coding through Blender, a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software that can create animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games. Whether you're a Blender expert or an avid Python coder (of which I was neither when I first started undertaking this project), hopefully you'll learn some useful skills. At the end of the first tutorial, we'll be able to produce a simple, but useful visualization of population pyramids from different countries! In the process, hopefully you'll be familiar with:
* the basics of Blender
* the basics of coding in Python
* 3D visualization using a powerful computer science tool and computer graphics software. 

# downloads to get started
## Blender
https://www.blender.org/download/

Click on this link and download the most recent version (currently is Blender 2.90.1) and the version that is compatible with your operating system. It's free to download, use, and share.

## Python3
In case you're unsure if you have Python downloaded, you can open the command line in Terminal on Mac and type `python3 --version` and press `enter`. If the version number comes up, then you should have Python3 downloaded. If a version number is not returned then it probably means that you don't have python installed. 

Anaconda is a package manager, environment manager and a Python distribution. It helps manage commonly used data science libraries. I personally used this to download Python, but feel free to download Python3 however you want.

# Blender basics

Hotkeys: 
- G is for grab - to grab wherever your cursor is
  - If you type G, then Z, then it will grab and when you move your cursor, will move throughout the Z axis. 
- S is for scale - to scale whatever is selected
- Shift D - copies and paste the cube somewhere else 
- Shift A - whenever you want to add something 
- "Perfection is the virtual perfection" - quote from YouTube tutorial 
- Marlon's intro video? 

# Python basics

*Syntax*
- Line breaks conclude a statement (not a semicolon as in other languages)
- Blocks of statement begin with a colon and identified with indent
- Declaration of variable doesn't require datatype
- Make comments by initiating the statement with a (#)
-

# Making our first graph

# future projects
* Visualize population pyramids over time 
* Visualize population pyramids based on location on the map
