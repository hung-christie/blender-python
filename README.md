# blender-python
This is a project to teach basic python coding through Blender, a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software that can create animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games. Whether you're a Blender expert or an avid Python coder (of which I was neither when I first started undertaking this project), hopefully you'll learn some useful skills. At the end of the first tutorial, hopefully we'll able to produce a simple, but useful visualization of population pyramids from different countries! In the process, hopefully you'll be familiar with:
* the basics of Blender
* the basics of coding in Python
* 3D visualization using a powerful computer science tool and computer graphics software. 

This tutorial is currently written for macOS, but hopefully we'll be adapt this to Windows and other operating systems. 

# downloads to get started
## Blender
https://www.blender.org/download/

Click on this link and download the most recent version (currently is Blender 2.90.1) and the version that is compatible with your operating system. It's free to download, use, and share - it's a free software! 

## Python3
Anaconda is a package manager, environment manager and a Python distribution. It helps manage commonly used data science libraries. I personally used this to download Python, but feel free to download Python3 however you want!

# future projects
* Visualize population pyramids over time
